hint

WHAT?

help

I KNOW OF PLACES, ACTIONS, AND THINGS.  MOST OF MY VOCABULARY
DESCRIBES PLACES AND IS USED TO MOVE YOU THERE.  TO MOVE, TRY WORDS
LIKE FOREST, BUILDING, DOWNSTREAM, ENTER, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH,
UP, OR DOWN.  I KNOW ABOUT A FEW SPECIAL OBJECTS, LIKE A BLACK ROD
HIDDEN IN THE CAVE.  THESE OBJECTS CAN BE MANIPULATED USING SOME OF
THE ACTION WORDS THAT I KNOW.  USUALLY YOU WILL NEED TO GIVE BOTH THE
OBJECT AND ACTION WORDS (IN EITHER ORDER), BUT SOMETIMES I CAN INFER
THE OBJECT FROM THE VERB ALONE.  SOME OBJECTS ALSO IMPLY VERBS; IN
PARTICULAR, "INVENTORY" IMPLIES "TAKE INVENTORY", WHICH CAUSES ME TO
GIVE YOU A LIST OF WHAT YOU'RE CARRYING.  THE OBJECTS HAVE SIDE
EFFECTS; FOR INSTANCE, THE ROD SCARES THE BIRD.  USUALLY PEOPLE HAVING
TROUBLE MOVING JUST NEED TO TRY A FEW MORE WORDS.  USUALLY PEOPLE
TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO MANIPULATE AN OBJECT ARE ATTEMPTING SOMETHING
BEYOND THEIR (OR MY!) CAPABILITIES AND SHOULD TRY A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT TACK.  TO SPEED THE GAME YOU CAN SOMETIMES MOVE LONG
DISTANCES WITH A SINGLE WORD.  FOR EXAMPLE, "BUILDING" USUALLY GETS
YOU TO THE BUILDING FROM ANYWHERE ABOVE GROUND EXCEPT WHEN LOST IN THE
FOREST.  ALSO, NOTE THAT CAVE PASSAGES TURN A LOT, AND THAT LEAVING A
ROOM TO THE NORTH DOES NOT GUARANTEE ENTERING THE NEXT FROM THE SOUTH.
GOOD LUCK!
