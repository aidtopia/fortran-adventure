## Contributing

This is primarily a personal project, but I'm open to contributions from others.

Go ahead and send a pull request on Github for small fixes, especially for compatibility with compilers other than MSVC and operating systems other than Windows.

If you're considering contributing something more substantial, please pitch your idea by opening an issue in Github first.  This is still a small, young project, and I'd like to keep it quick to iterate for a while longer.  For now, I specifically avoiding a cross-platform build systems and external dependencies.  I'm still likely to make sweeping refactors and architecture changes, which could make it difficult for to integrate any larger changes not at head.

### Contributors

I like to thank,

Chris Spiegel (@cspiegel) for portability fixes.  (The very first pull requests I've ever received in any of my Github repositories.)
